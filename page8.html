						<ul>
						<li><b>iTokri</b><br></li>
					<p>iTokri is an online platform best described as “a store with a story”. The store offers a wide range of products, be it in personal grooming or home décor. iTokri aims to bring together many innovative design and craft businesses in India which need a logistics centre, thus building a store, which understands Indian shopping sensibilities, and develops a creative and sustainable model for craftspeople at the same time.<br><br>
						<li><b>Chanderiyaan</b><br></li>
					<p>Chanderiyaan is an e-commerce platform set up to help artisans from Madhya Pradesh showcase the skills of Chanderi weavers. Chanderiyaan has a wide range of pure ethnic Chanderi designer handiwork. It is a platform to share the richness of weaving and design patterns evolved through centuries in this weaving town with its historical dynamics and stories waiting to be discovered.<br><br>
						<li><b>Peoli</b><br></li>
					<p>Peoli, which means ‘spring flower’, offers hand-knit apparel (sweaters, dresses, tunics), accessories (stoles, cowls, shawls, ponchos gloves, caps), blankets, floor coverings, cushion covers, etc. They make sure they use natural materials and dyes to save the environment. The craftswomen of the hills weave each piece with warmth and love. Peoli aims at nurturing the creativity of the hand and cultivating a culture of providing a fair means of livelihood to skilled people through sustainable practices and promotion of a sustainable lifestyle.<br><br>
						<li><b>Gaatha</b><br></li>
					<p>The team at Gaatha is not just involved in sales and product management. They aim to create a dialogue between the artisans and the global audience, through the stories and ideologies drafted by them. The project was conjured to play the key role of storytelling, besides bringing social and commercial benefit to the artisans.<br><br>
						<li><b>Emithlahaat</b><br></li>
					<p>Emithlahaat was born to help artisans of Mithila who are skilled Madhubani painters. Most of the artisans did not have the means/platform to sell their products to the customers, and mediators used to abuse them by quoting lower prices. Emithlahaat serves as a platform that would directly connect the buyer and sellers, thereby allowing artisans to get a fair price. Emithlahaat not only offers a wide variety of paintings, but women’s kurtis and jewellery as well.<br><br>
