				<font face="freehand521 bj" size=5>Handicrafts Of Assam</font><hr color="red" width="280" align ="left"><br>
					<p>The tribes and peoples of Assam have eked out a rich and colourful heritage of crafts from what may seem a sparse existence.<br><br>
				<font face="constantina" size=4><b>Cane, Bamboo &amp; Reeds :-<br></font></b>
					<p>The variety of canes and reeds, as well as the bamboo native to the region has dictated a range of eco-friendly essentials.<br>
					<p> The hollowed bamboo mugs and containers and the cane basketry and furniture are perhaps the most popular. Also notable among woodcrafts are animal figures, such as the rhino or water birds, and root sculptures.<br><br>
				<font face="constantina" size=4><b>Textiles :-<br></font></b>
					<p>Assam is renowned for its silks. The ‘muga’ is most prized of these, but there is also ‘endi’ and ‘magar’, as well as the more usual ‘mulberry’ silks. These are woven into beautiful sarees and furnishings.In recent years, jute textiles have been taken beyond furnishings to hand-made accessories, luggage and footwear.<br><br>
				<font face="constantina" size=4><b>Jewellery :-<br></font></b>
					<p>Apart from the range of tribal jewellery native to this state, there are also enameled work and jeweled gold ornaments. Craftsmen still make use of traditional motifs as well as forms, and these could well become precious heirlooms.<br><br>
				<font face="constantina" size=4><b>Metal Craft &amp; Regional Specialities :-<br></font></b>
					<p>You will find both brass and bell metal- beaten and moulded and graven- cast into ‘thalis’ (plates), bowls and ‘serais (covered goblets) that have been in use in this region for ages. Though more contemporary uses include votive offerings and decorative pieces, it is these more heritage-laden articles that catch the imagination. And nothing captures the spirit of this hill state better than the woven cane hats decorated with threadwork, appliqué and ‘shola pith’ or bamboo, the ‘japi’, often displayed with the decorated ‘jathi’ spears.
