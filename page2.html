<p>The exotic spectrum of Rajasthan's handicraft heritage is a dazzling kaleidoscope of colours and textures.<br><br>
<font face="constantina" size=4><b>Textiles :-<br></font></b>
<p>Handcrafted textiles adorn the colourful bazaars of Rajasthan.There is tie and dye work from Jodhpur, the distinctive native hand-block fabrics of Sanganer and Bagru villages around Jaipur and the 'lehariya' prints from the villages around Udaipur.<br><br>
<font face="constantina" size=4><b>Jewellery :-<br></font></b>
<p>Jaipur is one of the world's leading diamond and emerald cutting centres. The tradition of 'Minakari' and 'Kundan' work in gold reached an all time high in enamel jewellery centres like Bikaner, since Mughal times. From Pratapgarh comes the pretty 'Thewa' work, gold filigree work on glass which is seeing a revival. Ivory and Lac bangles, and silver tribal ornaments made in Rajasthan are stunning in their artistry.<br><br>
<font face="constantina" size=4><b>Paintings :-<br></font></b>
<p>Mughal miniature painting is richly represented in Rajasthani art.From Nathdwara came the tradition of 'pichwais'. The 'pichwai' was a cloth hanging or backdrop to the deity Krishna, painted in bold colours.<br><br>
<font face="constantina" size=4><b>Pottery, Stone Craft &amp; Leatherwork :-<br></font></b>
<p>Pottery tradition of Jaipur is translated into its various hues of blue pottery which is made from crushed quartz. This is embellished with painted motifs in geometrics and nature's bounty in bright yellows, oranges and green.. Its skilled stone carving is evident in beautiful fretwork, carved deities and elaborate columns. Marble tabletops, lamps and candle stands bear the fine detailing at which the native craftsmen are so skilled. Rajasthan's leather craft tradition is showcased in its 'juttis', both plain and embellished. Bikaner's famous 'gesso' work (treated camel leather) is available in a range of boxes, lampshades and containers.
